/**
 * Execute the parts of the title's pushbuffer that produce visible pixels.
 *
 * The title builds NV2A commands in guest RAM and advances DMA_PUT; without
 * something consuming them the framebuffer stays whatever it was, which is how
 * a fully booted title renders a black screen. This walks the same command
 * stream nv2a_pb_scan.c surveys and carries out the subset that decides what is
 * on screen: which surface is being drawn into, and clearing it.
 *
 * It also rasterises geometry, but only the part that can be drawn honestly:
 * batches whose attribute 0 is already in screen space, flat-shaded, straight
 * into the same guest framebuffer the clear writes. Titles draw their UI, HUD
 * and 2D overlays that way, so it is the first geometry to appear. Batches that
 * need a vertex program executed are counted and skipped rather than drawn
 * somewhere wrong -- see raster_batch(). Texturing, depth and vertex programs
 * are still a renderer, not a command decoder; the upgrade path is the D3D11
 * translator in src/nv2a/nv2a_pgraph_d3d11.c.
 *
 * Everything this does not handle is counted and ranked by
 * nv2a_pb_exec_report(), so what remains is a list rather than a guess.
 *
 * Enabled with RECOMP_PB_EXEC. RECOMP_RASTER_TEST draws one known triangle
 * after every clear, which separates "the pixel path is broken" from "the title
 * has not given us any vertices". RECOMP_FB_DUMP=<prefix> writes the surface to
 * <prefix>NNN.bmp, so the result can be looked at without a display.

/* Would writing this surface land on the title's own image?
 *
 * NV097_SET_SURFACE_COLOR_OFFSET is an offset within the colour DMA object,
 * not a guest virtual address, and this executor has always used it as one.
 * That is harmless while the two happen to agree and catastrophic when they do
 * not: the Xbox Dashboard names surface 0x00088000 at 1280x960x4, so clearing
 * it wrote 4.9 MB of opaque black from 0x00088000 to 0x00538000 -- straight
 * over its own code, its D3D context at 0x000BBFC0 and the register-block
 * pointer at 0x000BE2C4. The symptom was a title that submitted one perfect
 * frame and then spun forever in a pushbuffer-full loop, three layers away,
 * with every D3D global reading 0xFF000000: the clear colour.
 *
 * So refuse, and say so. Getting the address right needs the DMA object base
 * this ignores (NV097_SET_CONTEXT_DMA_COLOR); until that exists, writing
 * nothing is strictly better than writing over the guest, and a title that
 * cannot draw is easier to debug than one that has been overwritten.

/* Where a DMA-object offset actually lives.
 *
 * NV097_SET_SURFACE_COLOR_OFFSET is an offset inside the colour DMA object,
 * and for a framebuffer that object covers physical memory -- so the offset
 * is a physical address, not a guest VA. Those are the same number in this
 * runtime, which is why treating it as a VA works until it does not: on
 * hardware the image is mapped at VA 0x00010000 from arbitrary physical
 * pages, so a framebuffer at physical 0x84000 does not overlap it. Here it
 * would.
 *
 * The title tells us which it is by where it allocated. Half-Life 2's
 * framebuffer comes from MmAllocateContiguousMemory, which this runtime
 * serves from the window at XBOX_CONTIG_BASE, so physical P is visible at
 * XBOX_CONTIG_BASE + P -- clear of the image, and the same bytes the title's
 * own writes and the framebuffer window reach.
 *
 * So: use the offset as a VA when that is credible, and fall back to the
 * physical mirror exactly when it is not. Titles whose surfaces already sit
 * in ordinary RAM (Wreckless renders to the tiled alias of physical
 * 0x01954000) keep the first path and are unaffected.

     * title's own writes go through the window, so the executor's must too.
     *
     * Checking this BEFORE the image test is the whole point. The image test
     * only catches an offset that would land on the title's code, and whether
     * it does is an accident of where the image happens to end: Half-Life 2's
     * colour surface is physical 0x00A6C000, which clears the image by 700 KB.
     * So it looked like an ordinary VA, and the executor cleared 1.2 MB of
     * black straight through the guest heap -- which faulted the title three
